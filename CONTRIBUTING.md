# Contributing to WELLAIOS AI Agent Tools

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the WELLAIOS AI Agent Tools ecosystem! This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing, whether you're enhancing this central Tools Catalog or making improvements to the individual tool repositories it lists.

Your contributions help us expand capabilities, improve existing tools, and foster a more robust and user-friendly experience for AI agents within the WELLAIOS ecosystem.

## What Kinds of Contributions are We Looking For?

We welcome a variety of contributions across our projects. Please identify which area your contribution falls into:

1.  **Contributing to _This_ Catalog Repository** (`tools-directory`)

    This repository primarily focuses on the organization and documentation of WELLAIOS tools. Contributions here involve enhancing the catalog's content and structure.

    - **Adding New Tool Entries**:

      If you've developed a new MCP-compatible tool that extends the capabilities of WELLAIOS AI Agents, we'd love to list it here!

      - **Prerequisites for Submission**:

        - Ensure your tool is fully **MCP-compatible** and ideally follows the WELLAIOS framework's approach to user authorization (if applicable).

        - Your tool should have its **own dedicated GitHub repository** with a clear `README.md` detailing its purpose, prerequisites, installation steps, usage instructions, and licensing.

        - Consider whether your tool offers **unique functionality** or a different deployment approach compared to existing listed tools.

        - We strongly recommend adhering to [security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#security-considerations) as outlined in the MCP documentation for your tool's implementation.

      - **Submission Process**:

        - Create a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of this repository.

        - In your PR, add a new entry to the `README.md`.

        - Ensure new entries are added in alphabetical order within their respective categories to minimize merge conflicts.

        - Provide a concise and informative description of your tool and what it demonstrates, following the existing style.

    - **Enhancements to Existing Tool Entries**:

      Help us improve the clarity and accuracy of the catalog!

      - Updating Descriptions: If a tool's functionality has changed, or you have a clearer way to describe what it does or demonstrates.

      - Fixing Broken Links: Report or fix any non-working links to tool repositories or other resources.

      - Categorization Improvements: Suggest better ways to organize tools or propose new grouping methods for improved navigation (if applicable in the future).

    - **General Documentation Improvements**:

      Even minor documentation fixes are valuable!

      - Correcting Typos or Grammatical Errors: Help us polish the language throughout the `README.md` and this `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

      - Improving Clarity: Rephrase sentences or sections that might be confusing or difficult to understand.

      - Adding Examples: Suggest or add clearer examples where appropriate (e.g., for the workflow descriptions).

2.  Contributing to Individual WELLAIOS Tool Repositories

    We actively encourage contributions to enhance the functionality and quality of the individual WELLAIOS tools listed in this catalog! This includes:

    - Bug Fixes: Identifying and resolving issues within a tool's code.

    - New Features: Adding new capabilities or integrations to a tool.

    - Performance Improvements: Optimizing a tool for faster or more efficient operation.

    - Security Enhancements: Strengthening a tool's security posture.

    - Documentation within the Tool's Repo: Improving the `README.md`, setup instructions, usage examples, or technical documentation specific to that tool.

    **How to Contribute to an Individual Tool**:

    To contribute directly to the code or documentation of a specific tool, please:

    1. Navigate to that tool's dedicated GitHub repository (e.g., `WELLAIOS-DEV/tool-cryptoplot-serverless`).

    2. For bug reports, feature requests, or discussions specific to that tool, please open an `Issue` directly in its repository.

    3. For code changes or documentation updates, create a Pull Request (PR) directly to that tool's repository.
